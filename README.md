# FunctionGravitySimulator
App powered by matplotlib which lets the user throw balls at functions.

## Installation

Download the .exe file of the latest release and execute it by double-click.

## Features

Left-click on the graph to throw a ball. While holding the ball, you can resize it by holding the right mouse 
button. You can change the plotted graph in the text field by simply typing in another function.
Adjust the bounciness of the balls with the slider and delete them with the provided button.
You can zoom in or out with the toolbar pan tool. The box zoom might cause the window size to change, therefore 
it is recommended to not use it.
